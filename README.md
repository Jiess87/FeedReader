# Project Overview

In this project you are given a web-based application that reads RSS feeds. The original developer of this application clearly saw the value in testing, they've already included [Jasmine](http://jasmine.github.io/) and even started writing their first test suite! Unfortunately, they decided to move on to start their own company and we're now left with an application with an incomplete test suite. That's where you come in.


#Presentation and Usage

This is a web-based application that reads multiple RSS feeds, simply unpack all files within a directory and run index.html to see it in action.

The menu icon in the top left of the app will slide in (or out) a feed selector, click on the desired feed's name to load it.
